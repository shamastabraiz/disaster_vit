## 📦 Dataset: DisasterViT Dataset

We used a **custom disaster image dataset**, referred to as the **DisasterViT Dataset**, specifically curated for this research. It contains labeled aerial imagery across the following 4 natural disaster classes:

- 🌪️ Cyclone
- 🌍 Earthquake
- 🌊 Flood
- 🔥 Wildfire
The dataset can be downloaded by using Google Drive:
